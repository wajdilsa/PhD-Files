359,IRAQ,Dissertation,A framework for the sustainability assessment of urban design and development in Iraqi cities,2017,"The assessment of urban sustainability is increasingly being seen as essential to mitigate the undesirable impacts of urbanisation in cities while improving communities’ resilience to environmental, social and economic changes. Several urban sustainability assessment tools (USATs) have been developed to make such informed decision-making. In addition to their role as an enabler for stakeholder engagement and increased public awareness throughout the lifecycle of an urban development project, USATs act as a catalyst to increase market demand for sustainable products and services by providing a mechanism for recognising excellence. Most current USATs have been developed based on the needs of developed nations which are different from those of developing countries, especially those affected by natural disasters and man-made events e.g. wars. Iraq has endured several decades of war and subsequent international sanctions which have affected its overall economy, infrastructure, public services and utilities. In consequence, rebuilding, rehabilitation and the development of new cities and urban areas are currently underway but without evidence of attention to sustainability and public participation in decision-making. This research aimed to investigate the factors affecting urban sustainability in Iraq through a literature review and stakeholder consultations, leading to the development of a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework for urban design and development projects. The proposed framework included attention to the local environmental, social and economic aspects and urban challenges, in addition to how to promote awareness and stakeholder participation. The methodology included: (a) an analytical comparison of a range of global USATs to define relevant urban indicators; (b) determination of the urban challenges in the Iraqi context, through an extensive review of the literature; (c) investigation of key local urban challenges from the stakeholder perspective by conducting a nationwide questionnaire, and (d) identification and prioritisation of local assessment factors by consultation with a panel of experts, conducting a consensus-built method and application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to allocate credits and rating formulas. This comprehensive consultation methodology is a unique contribution of the research to identify the key quantitative and qualitative assessment factors. The Iraqi urban sustainability assessment framework (IUSAF) comprises of 89 urban factors, ten of which are mandatory, which can be considered fundamental urban factors to assess the sustainability of a project. The results have revealed that ‘water’ was ranked as the most important factor with 8.5% of the total weight, ‘safety and security’ was second at 7.9 %, followed by ‘transportation and infrastructure’, ‘housing’, and ‘local economy’, demonstrating a link between deficiencies in the provision of environmental and socio-economic infrastructure in Iraq. These findings evidence that the IUSAF is based on an understanding of key local urban challenges and issues, this significantly different from a range of USATs currently in use, regarding urban factors (indicators, sub-indicators), their priorities and weighting systems. The IUSAF was validated using three urban development case studies of varying complexities. The applicability analysis reported the IUSAF as appropriate to assess urban sustainability. The final results of the testing process have validated the need for IUSAF to assess existing urban design and development which has been planned and developed in an unsustainable manner. IUSAF stands to create many substantial benefits as it has the capacity to raise awareness about urban sustainability issues for developers, specialists and decision-makers and to constitute a plan of action for current and new urban development projects in Iraqi cities.","In this paper, the authors investigated the factors affecting urban sustainability in Iraq through a literature review and stakeholder consultations, leading to the development of a comprehensive sustainability assessment framework for urban design and development projects."," - The paper discusses the development of an Iraqi Urban Sustainability Assessment Framework (IUSAF) to assess urban sustainability in Iraqi cities.

Countries in conflict have neither the capacity nor the political will to deal with climate change and its consequences. Iraq, one of the most vulnerable states to suffer the effects of climate change is a case in point. Decades of conflict, political upheavals and weak governance have destroyed the country’s infrastructure and environment. Security and political challenges are more urgent priorities for local authorities than dealing with the risks and consequences from environment destruction and climate change in the longer term. The recent call by the United States (US) top diplomat to the Iraqi government for swift actions by the government while disregarding the inability and lack of political will to address climate change is worthy of note (Shafaq News 2022).

368,IRAQ,Dissertation,Creation of local comprehensive sustainability framework for developing cities: A case study in the Iraqi capital Baghdad,2019,"Cities are responsible for a high percentage of CO2 emissions and environmental pollution. This is due to rapid urbanization, population growth, lack of environmental strategies, and increasing transport and energy demand. Thus, there is an essential need to adopt urban sustainability frameworks to guide future development combatting current and future environmental challenges. 
However, developing urban sustainability frameworks presents increasingly major challenges in developing countries, specifically in unstable regions, due to locality specific issues such as; lack of environmental strategy, increased transport and energy demand, population-inflation and housing deficit. Previous studies have developed sustainability frameworks based on the requirements of developed countries which are different from those of developing countries, in particular, those affected by harsh conditions such as wars. 
This study will focus on the development of a comprehensive sustainability framework for Iraq. Iraq has faced several decades of war and international sanctions, impacting its overall public services and utilities, socio-economy, and infrastructure. Thus, there are many local issues that must be considered. Additionally, it is vital to ensure public engagement and involvement in decision-making in any developments. 
This study has engaged with the Iraqi public, through an online survey, in order to investigate their role as a stakeholder and to; identify their priorities, gather their assessment of the current public services and utilities, and stimulate increased public awareness towards urban sustainable development goals. 
Informed by this survey, an expert consultation was conducted using the Delphi technique to identify the consituent indicators of the framework. Statistical analysis was then used to identify the significant differences between public perceptions and expert views. This revealed that there were 13 areas that showed significant differences in views and six areas that showed no differences in views. Thus, this demonstrates how the current international guidelines, such as BREEAM, LEED, CASBEE, and etc are not fully applicable for developing countries. In response to all these factors, this study has developed the Local Comprehensive Sustainability Framework (LCSF) to inform decision-makers and city developers on how to improve current and future city development in Baghdad, Iraq. 
v 
The key novelty of this framework is that most previous work has focused on the development of urban assessment frameworks, including only environmental, social, and economic indicators, while this study has also added additional indicators/strategies including future urban planning, future domestic criteria for low energy housing, and a set of urban sustainable development factors. This framework, in contrast to most existing work, is informed by the views of the public, a key difference from previous works that factor in only expert viewpoints. 
The LCSF has been validated using semi-structured interviews with 15 intraorgansational leaders in order to ensure it is suitable and applicable. The results showed that 12 out of 15 leaders highly recommended the adoption of the framework. This validation reported that the LCSF is an appropriate way to assess and solve multiple urban issues and local problems, in particular in the Iraqi capital Baghdad. The final step of the validation process was to demonstrate the framework to the Mayoralty of Baghdad. The Mayoralty considered the framework valid and forwarded it to policy-makers suggesting its adoption as a plan of action for current and new urban development projects in the Iraqi cities, specifically the capital Baghdad. 
The key contributions of this study are; (a) its methodological approach to investigating locality specific problems based on engagement with stakeholders, including public perceptions and an expert consultation, (b) the development of the LCSF, (c) engagement with intra-organsational leadership in order to validate the LCSF in politically-unstable countries and (d) use of a statistical method to show the significant differences between the public views and the experts' viewpoints in order to inform policy-makers before applying the LSCF.","The study developed the Local Comprehensive Sustainability Framework (LCSF) specifically for Baghdad, Iraq, to guide decision-makers and city developers in improving current and future urban development, addressing local issues such as public services, utilities, and urban sustainability goals.

313,UAE,,Co-designing a social innovation model for changemakers,2018,"As design educators at Zayed University, Dubai, in the UAE we believe in the educational capacities of social innovation and in the exploration of new models and processes of systemic design. Particularly in the field of education, continuous innovation is both necessary and possible if we are to imagine new ways for young people to realize their full potential.

The current higher education system in the Middle East and South Asian regions often represents a socially narrow and dated curriculum that is especially limited in its ability to cultivate empathetic, driven and holistic young leaders and changemakers. Our education system in the UAE has not evolved yet to be imaginative, integrated, or reflective of the complex realities youth experience. Social innovation in education allows for re-imagining how we may create spaces for creative youth engagement and develop models that enable young people to realize their potential as changemakers. The question we explored was ‘How might we co-design an immersive, transformative, and sustainable changemaker pathway for social innovation?’ To do this, we leveraged community initiative and institutional support from Zayed University to build a platform to social innovation named INNOCO (Innovation and Co-design). Simply put, INNOCO actively supports young people interested in building their capacities as changemakers. Hence, it strives to disrupt a linear educational approaches and builds on the need for a paradigm shift in education in the region.

In three (3) years INNOCO has developed a research framework that has been successfully implemented and has already been modeled for a partner project at Zayed University; has facilitated a youth engagement program with participants in UAE and Nepal; and, has chronicled the changemaker journeys of program participants through quantitative and qualitative narratives. Through these cumulative processes, youth explored ways in which they could connect, collaborate and contribute to their larger communities. The proposed paper will detail the following critical aspects of our work with the hope that an engaged audience of educators and systems thinkers may learn from our shared experiences and enrich our collective knowledge.

Values of Co-design and Commitment to Social Innovation

Co-design was and continues to be a guiding principle in our work. We understand it to be an approach that fosters inclusivity, participation and celebration of collective ownership and achievement. Our efforts to implement principles of co-design into all aspects of vertical learning took shape in brainstorming and feedback sessions, open communication with participants through accessible platforms, and in regular meeting sessions to reflect on program activities and identify strength and improvement opportunities. Although the processes for co-design can be slow, complex and highly iterative, we believe it to be a promising pathway to social change allowing community participation. From 2015-2018 our co-design process involved approximately 116 experts, facilitators and organizations from diverse backgrounds and sectors. When done right, co-design can yield lasting, meaningful impacts that permeate through individual, community and systemic levels.

The value we assigned to co-design was also instrumental in deepening our understanding of social innovation. The term ‘social innovation’ has become increasingly popular and can mean different things to different people. We brought diverse voices and perspectives together following the principles of co-design and appreciative inquiry to clarify collective vision and to support individuals for their capacity development. We are committed to social innovation as initiatives that ‘are not only good for society but also enhance society’s capacity to act.’ (Hubert et.al., 2010).

Research framework

Our research model is a human-centered and evidence-informed one titled ‘ME=WE’ that resonates with the Panarchy Theory to understand the systemic and symbiotic relationships between self (ME) and society (WE). The framework focuses on ‘action and reflection’ contributing to social change that one can affect at an individual, community and systemic level (Lampel 2003).

Wise and diverse communities across our world adopt this simple philosophy. In Indonesia the

Balinese principle of ‘tattwa masi’ translates to ‘you are we and we are you’. Similarly, the South African philosophy of “Ubuntu” teaches that our humanity is reflected in the achievements and humanity of others, intrinsically connecting the ‘self’ with the collective. This framework also manifests in the Mobius strip, a mathematical phenomena that demonstrates infinite and continuous movement and sprouting growth.

The ME=WE framework acts as a pathway that begins with the individual as a changemaker who engages with their community and systemic change through a continuous cycle of growth, action and reflection. The individual journey mirrors the expansive and moving structure of this framework as they engage in activities grounded in empathy, trust, creative confidence and communication. Through this work, the individual experiences growth points between action and reflection allowing for enriching their knowledge and capacities and deepening appreciative inquiry mode as continuously leaping from ME to WE and WE to ME.

Program Tools

A flexible and imaginative program as a series of independent workshops or an intensive 9-day bootcamp was developed to facilitate socially minded youth engagement. The program objective is to build collective capacity in planning and developing entrepreneurial and/or community-driven service projects. Workshop sessions introduced youth to hands-on and experiential learning through empathy driven tools, storytelling techniques, value proposition canvas, design thinking practices and more.

The INNOCO program was piloted with youth in UAE and in Nepal in varying forms. In UAE (2016-2017) a six month workshop series was implemented where 20 youth experienced learning and collaboration however, participants were not ready to move forward with social enterprise projects. In Nepal (2016 – 2018), the program was initially piloted with select youth and evolved into a 9-day innovation bootcamp with 18 youth. The innovation bootcamp was well-received by youth who continue to be engaged with social change for their communities. The program also included a mentorship component where seven mentors were identified and recruited from Nepal and internationally, matched with youth mentees to foster intimate relationships of learning and expansion. At the end of the Nepal bootcamp, (9) ideas were pitched to a panel of community judges, out of which (7) have emerged as viable projects in development.

Impact Stories

The impacts of our work are illustrated through quantitative and qualitative data collected at different stages of the Nepal run program. While our impact assessment data is primarily qualitative gathered through transcribed one-on-one in-depth interviews, quantitative data was also collected through post program surveys.

Analysis of the quantitative narratives shows that the program was highly rated by participants especially in the areas of bootcamp environment and cultivating culture. These were critical areas for us as we attempted to create an unconventional learning environment and culture that valued co-design where youth could contribute to the process in fulsome ways. On a scale of 1-5 (5 is very satisfied; 1is unsatisfied) participants rated key areas of their experience, below is a snapshot of average rating scores: Workshop Quality: 4.1 / 5; Content Relevance: 4 / 5; Culture & Space: 4.6 / 5; Expectations Met: 4 / 5; Interaction: 4.2 / 5; Creative confidence: 4 / 5.

The qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews was used to develop a set of illustrated changemaker stories to further our Knowledge Translation and Exchange (KTE) efforts. The stories follow youth participants who completed the INNOCO program and demonstrate the transformative change they experienced that led to actions on individual, community and systemic levels.

The seven viable projects that emerged from the Nepal bootcamp, are in there initial developmental or operational phases. This includes a literacy and reading program in a rural community; a homestay for women facing domestic violence; a hydroponic farm; and a kiwi farm and waste management system. The Nepal youth group also realized their vision by registering as the Nepal Youth Innovators (NYI), a space for young people to connect to like minded changemakers and cultivate meaningful connections and collaborations to better contribute to social change.

In summary, the key areas of co-design as an overarching value enabled redefining the ME=WE framework that was then translated into a comprehensive and flexible set of program tools for youth engagement. The impacts of this social innovation model in its entirety is both powerful and promising for future work. The ME=WE framework has already been used as the foundation for another project based at Zayed University that aims to innovate food systems, and at Impact Hub at Georgian University in the USA. The program tools will soon be shared on an online platform for youth, educators and/or academics to easily access and adapt for their local communities. We believe that INNOCO is a strong example of a social innovation pathway that cultivates young changemakers and a study in co-designing alternative forms of learning that disrupt linear models. As one of the Nepal youth participants so aptly states “What we learn in schools is not everything, I want kids and young adults to learn life skills that will bring out the best person that they can be”",Innovation and Co-design (INNOCO) as mentioned in this paper is a research framework that has been successfully implemented and has already been modeled for a partner project at Zayed University; has facilitated a youth engagement program with participants in UAE and Nepal; and chronicled the changemaker journeys of program participants through quantitative and qualitative narratives.," - The paper discusses the application of a social innovation model named INNOCO, which actively supports young people in building their capacities as changemakers, disrupting linear educational approaches, and fostering a paradigm shift in education in the region.

306,UAE,Journal Article,Content-Localization based System for Analyzing Sentiment and Hate Behaviors in Low-Resource Dialectal Arabic: English to Levantine and Gulf,2023,"Even though online social movements can quickly become viral on social media, languages can be a barrier to timely monitoring and analyzing the underlying online social behaviors (OSB). This is especially true for under-resourced languages on social media like dialectal Arabic; the primary language used by Arabs on social media. Therefore, it is crucial to provide solutions to efficiently exploit resources from high-resourced languages to solve language-dependent OSB analysis in under-resourced languages. This paper proposes to localize content of resources in high-resourced languages into under-resourced Arabic dialects. Content localization goes beyond content translation that converts text from one language to another; content localization adapts culture, language nuances and regional preferences from one language to a specific language/dialect. Automating understanding of the natural and familiar day-to-day expressions in different regions, is the key to achieve a wider analysis of OSB especially for smart cities. In this paper, we utilize content-localization based neural machine translation to develop sentiment and hate classifiers for two low-resourced Arabic dialects: Levantine and Gulf. Not only this but we also leverage unsupervised learning to facilitate the analysis of sentiment and hate predictions by inferring hidden topics from the corresponding data and providing coherent interpretations of those topics in their native language/dialects. The experimental evaluations and proof-of-concept COVID-19 case study on real data have validated the effectiveness of our proposed system in precisely distinguishing sentiments and accurately identifying hate content in both Levantine and Gulf Arabic dialects. Our findings shed light on the importance of considering the unique nature of dialects within the same language and ignoring the dialectal aspect would lead to misleading analysis.",This paper uses content-localization based neural machine translation to develop sentiment and hate classifiers for two low-resourced Arabic dialects: Levantine and Gulf and sheds light on the importance of considering the unique nature of dialects within the same language and ignoring the dialectal aspect would lead to misleading analysis.," - The paper discusses the application of content-localization based neural machine translation to develop sentiment and hate classifiers for two low-resourced Arabic dialects: Levantine and Gulf.

320,UAE,Book Chapter,Creative Contributions and Solutions to Dubai’s Challenges and Commitments as a Smart City: Transnationalizing and Personalizing Global Standards of Excellence in International Education,2019,"This paper contributes to the higher education system of Dubai as a Smart City given its public commitment to equating “excellence” with “global”. It substantiates and enriches global standards of excellence transnationally by adopting as global educational standard of excellence the concept of cosmopolitanism as the global individual cultural identity form of world citizenship, which finds increasing acceptance in international education theory and practice. Cosmopolitanism suits both the “excellence” and the “global” parts of Dubai’s commitment, since it is at the same time, a classical idea and a modern-day concept, a timeless philosophical ideal and a call for practical initiatives, a combination of local, national, regional, national international issues, and an incentive for individual and institutional inroads. Conceptually, cosmopolitanism is presented as a synthesized literature matrix complemented by substantial critical thinking. Empirically, it is shown how a group of highly multilingual international students revealed themselves, in in-depth interviews, in terms of their cosmopolitan identities. This allowed the analysis and synthesis of three new ideal types of cosmopolitans beyond the literature. The paper therefore (1) adds educational dimensions to Dubai’s Smart City character, (2) introduces new, transnational dimensions for global educational standards of excellence, and (3) makes innovative, recently tested frameworks available for individuals and institutions. Correspondingly, future research could (1) apply the results to other smart cities and their countries, (2) test further dimensions for global educational standards of excellence, (3) investigate causal relationships between language mastery and global identity, or use more quantitative methods or larger empirical samples.","In this paper, the concept of cosmopolitanism is presented as a synthesized literature matrix complemented by substantial critical thinking, and a group of highly multilingual international students revealed themselves, in in-depth interviews, in terms of their cosmopolitan identities."," - The paper discusses applications related to the higher education system of Dubai as a Smart City, focusing on equating ""excellence"" with ""global"" standards.

327,UAE,Book Chapter,Smart Dubai: Sensing Dubai Smart City for Smart Environment Management,2020,"Every city has a heart and soul of its own and may claim same rights as a human being. In early 2017 the court in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand ordered that the Ganges and its main tributary, the Yamuna, be accorded the status of living human entities [1]. The decision, which was welcomed by environmentalists, means that polluting or damaging the rivers will be legally equivalent to harming a person. The judges cited the example of the Whanganui River, revered by the indigenous Māori people, which was declared a living entity with full legal rights by the New Zealand government. The judges said the Ganges and Yamuna rivers and their tributaries would be “legal and living entities having the status of a legal person with all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities”. So, if we are to recognize the entire city to be a living entity, just like a smart human being, a smart city would also require constant monitoring of its health. Just like a human being using a smart band or a smart watch to sense his/her vital parameters such as temperature, blood pressure, glucose, heart rate, lipid profile, Vitamins etc. the smart city may also require several thousand sensors installed in its arteries and touch points to sense its vital organs. Just like a smart band transmitting vital statistics of a human being to a cloud, the measurement of sensors from the smart city touch points also requires to be transmitted to the cloud. Just like the human vital statistics are subjected to triggering health alerts in the event of spotting an anomaly, the smart city sensor data will also have to be subjected to rigorous analysis to observe if an anomaly of ill health to the smart city is spotted in any of its key node and alerts are triggered to the city guardians for immediate treatment. Furthermore, the process of diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and monitoring of human health becomes applicable for a smart city too.

311,UAE,Proceedings Article,Tourist Spot Recommendation from Images based on Age Group and Location for Dubai using Deep Transfer Learning,2022,"Tourism is an important sector which can boost the economy of a country. Tourist recommender systems are used to provide recommendations to tourists based on their preferences. The prime challenge a tourist face while visiting tourist spots in a country is in determining a tourist spot to visit next that best suits their age. This paper proposes a deep learning-based system called TSR-Net that recommends next tourist spot from images of a tourist in Dubai by predicting the age group and the current tourist spot. TSR-Net uses two pretrained MobileNet models for this purpose. One MobileNet predicts the age group from the image and the other MobileNet identifies the current tourist spot from the image. Once the age group and the current tourist spot are identified the next suitable tourist spot is recommended to the tourist. The TSR-Net is applied to datasets to evaluate its performance on age group classification (AGC) and tourist spot detection (TSD). Results proveed that the proposed model achieved the best accuracy of 82% and 100% for AGC and TSD. The proposed model was also tested on a custom dataset and showed satisfactory results. The TSR-Net classifies a person into one of 3 age groups (less than 18, 18-45, more than 45), identifies 4 tourist spots in Dubai, UAE (Burj Khalifa, Burj Al Arab, Atlantis, Ain Dubai) and recommends 20 different places.

The collaboration between regulatory bodies such as Ofwat and Ofgem to eliminate duplication of efforts and reduce conflicts between water and electricity sectors demonstrates a practical framework for integrated resource management. This approach can serve as a model for other cities aiming to develop adaptive smart grids that support the electrification of heating and transport sectors.","We see an energy fucused smart city evolution of the UK along with the project of “Smart London Plan (SLP).” A theoretical logic of business model innovation has been discussed and a research framework of evolving energy focused smart city is formulated. The starting point is the silo system. In the second stage, the private investment in smart meters establishes a basement for next stages. As results, the UK’s smart energy sector has evolved from smart meter installation through smart grid to new business models such as water-energy nexus and microgrid. Before smart meter installation of the government, the electricity system was centralized. However, after consumer engagement plan has been set to make them understand benefits that they can secure through smart meters, the customer behavior has been changed. The data analytics firm enables greater understanding of consumer behavior and it helps energy industry to be smart via controlling, securing and using that data to improve the energy system. In the third stage, distribution network operators (DNOs)’ access to smart meter data has been allowed and the segmentation starts. In the fourth stage, with collaboration of Ofwat and Ofgem, it is possible to eliminate unnecessary duplication of works and reduce interest conflict between water and electricity. In the fifth stage, smart meter and grid has been integrated as an “adaptive” system and a transition from DNO to DSO is accomplished for the integrated operation. Microgrid is a prototype for an “adaptive” smart grid. Previous steps enable London to accomplish a platform leadership to support the increasing electrification of the heating and transport sector and smart home."

It emphasizes the importance of nexus thinking, which could facilitate collaboration across different sectors and improve the overall effectiveness of climate resilience strategies in urban planning and development.","Although London boasts ambitious climate resilience (CR) targets,
implementation has so far been unconvincing, in part due to a
lack of integration between policy areas. Nexus thinking focuses
on the interlinkages between policy areas to overcome silos
which inhibit policy integration. Green infrastructure, sustainable
transport and urban form can all result in CR, however an
integrated approach to these areas is not evident in the London
context. This article explores their role through a nexus lens, the
urban climate resilience (UCR) nexus, by focusing on policy
implementation in the Boroughs of Greenwich and Southwark.
The research is two-tiered, firstly, through policy analysis, used to
understand how current policy performs in relation to the UCR
nexus, as well as informing the second phase of semi-structured
expert interviews to investigate the structures in place to deliver
policy. Despite little evidence of nexus thinking, London does
have innovative solutions to policy integration, particularly
through sustainable transport projects. However, Greenwich and
Southwark demonstrate resource and governance issues that
inhibit delivery. Nexus thinking can be the catalyst to support
delivery; although more innovative approaches to valuation
methods, partnership delivery, monitoring and evidence are
imperative if the UCR nexus is to be harnessed to deliver CR."

The contrasting effects of the different phases of London's LEZ highlight the importance of stricter regulations over time to achieve significant reductions in air pollutants like PM10. This implies that gradual implementation of more stringent measures may be necessary to ensure long-term effectiveness in reducing vehicular emissions and improving urban air quality.","Low-emission zones (LEZs) have been implemented widely in Europe to tackle air pollution sourced from vehicular emissions. We quantify the effectiveness of the world's largest LEZ—London's LEZ—in reducing its target pollutant, PM10. Using a difference-in-difference (DID) framework, we find that the least stringent phase I of London's LEZ induced a short-term increase in the roadside PM10 within the zone by about 14.8%, whereas the longer and more restrictive phase II significantly drove down the PM10 by 5.5%. We explore the underlying reasons behind the disparity in policy effect across stages. We show that upon the introduction of phase I, the traffic volume of targeted heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) and temporarily exempted light goods vehicles (LGVs) has substantially increased, outweighing the environmental effect of a higher proportion of greener vehicles. We provide possible behavioral explanations for this phenomenon."

We report atmospheric methane (CH4) mole fractions and δ13CH4 measurements from Imperial College London since early 2018 using a Picarro G2201-i analyser. Measurements from March 2018 to October 2020 were compared to simulations of CH4 mole fractions and δ13CH4 produced using the NAME dispersion model coupled with the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory, UK NAEI, and the global inventory, EDGAR, with model spatial resolutions of ~2 km, ~10 km, and ~25 km.

However, the simulation-observation comparison of δ13CH4 and the Keeling plot results indicate that emissions due to natural gas leaks in London are being underestimated in both the UK NAEI and EDGAR."

Human civilization has built around the ports and harbors by constructing fixed structures to support waterborne transport and enhance or sustain city functions for millennia. These artificially fixed structures are not in natural equilibrium with the environment (water and sediment). Access channels and the sea bottom adjacent to piers are often dredged to accommodate larger ships. Bottom sediment dredging is a part of port management. Where to place the dredged material is of primary concern for port authorities because of its sheer volume and the potential to be chemically contaminated. The London Convention and the London Protocol (LC/LP) are international treaties that provide a process in preventing pollution from dumping of contaminated material at sea, and finding sound alternatives such as confined disposal facilities, and using clean dredged material in wetland creation or beach nourishment, based on the precautionary approach. The Anthropocene (Anthropocene refers to the most recent period in Earth’s history when human activity started to impact significantly on the climate and ecosystems.) coast of ports, harbors, wetlands, shorelines, and beaches of the coastal megacities faces tremendous challenges in managing navigational and shoreline infrastructure in view of sea level rise and climate change. Dredged sediments are a resource and are a key to protection of shorelines. The benefits of being members of the LC/LP treaties are that there is a wealth of various national experiences on sediment management available via the network of LC/LP national experts and in the records of the LC/LP’s Meetings of Contracting Parties."

This paper examines how the SDGs can be localised to LNOB in the London boroughs of Newham and Tower Hamlets. These boroughs with one of the most ethnically diverse populations in the country are amongst the high grow boroughs of London but also with one of the highest social and economic deprivations. The research offers insights into how policy framework requires a targeted engagement with marginalised communities. The empowerment of such individuals and communities can in turn enable them to access opportunities that require higher levels of skills in their home boroughs and elsewhere in London. Additionally, the inclusion of cultural norms and practices can further strengthen the process to address the capability deprivations. This approach therefore has wider relevance to achieving the “LNOB” pledge of the SDGs. Globally, in both developed and developing countries, some marginalised communities living with intergenerational deprivations remain untouched by macro-level efforts."

By reducing pickup distance, SAVs could be a contender for a nonpersonal transportation system based on trip energy comparisons. The results provide a picture of future SAV systems for potential users and offer suggestions as to how operators can devise an optimal transportation strategy beyond the question of fleet size and how policymakers can improve the overall transport network and reduce its environmental impact based on energy consumption. As a result of its flexibility and parametric capability, the model can be utilized to inform any local authority how SAV services could be deployed in any city."

air quality. The results indicate strong seasonal variations, driven by increased natural ventilation rates

","The paper highlights the need for Transport for London (TfL) to enhance its climate resilience strategies in response to increasing temperature-related risks across the London Underground network. This includes implementing preventative maintenance measures at lower observed temperatures and earlier in the year to mitigate the impact of extreme heat on infrastructure and service reliability.

Improved data quality and stakeholder engagement are essential for effective climate adaptation decision-making. By refining data collection systems and fostering collaboration with external weather and climate data providers, TfL can better analyze fault exposure rates and develop targeted interventions to address vulnerabilities in the network due to climate change.","As the climate is changing, Transport for London (TfL), which owns and operates the London Underground network, is faced with operational challenges during periods of extreme weather, especially with heat, on its assets. This paper quantifies the impact of temperature across the three different environments on the London Underground network via fault exposure rates for point-related assets (the movable sections of track that allow trains to move to another line or route). The current and future changes in temperature due to climate change are discussed and the broad implications for TfL in terms of future heat risk management are considered. Focus areas to improve TfL's strategic decision-making capacities in the future are also suggested. Owned and operated by Transport for London (TfL), the London Underground (LU) is the oldest and one of the busiest urban metro networks in the world, spanning a large proportion of Greater London, United Kingdom (UK). However, the LU now operates in a different capacity and environment than during the Victorian era in which its design and construction commenced. There are physical, financial and planning limitations that constrain TfL's ability to adapt to the current and future climates. Consequently, compared with other metro systems, the LU network may face more, and potentially unique, circumstances leading to service disruption due to both infrastructure constraints and future climate change. The aim of this paper is to investigate the present and future impacts of temperature on the LU network and its infrastructure. This is achieved by reviewing the present-day and projected future climatological context of London and temperature variance across the LU network. Using a subset of LU assets, the impact of temperature on faults is then quantified using a fault exposure rate approach. These results are then discussed in the context of climate change adaptation for TfL and ways forward are suggested to improve climate resilience across the LU network. The LU network operates above and below ground, and therefore within a range of climatologically different environments. It can be grouped into three different types, herein defined as network types. The surface part comprises 55% of track and runs above ground. The sub-surface, which includes the oldest part of the LU network, comprises 8% of track, using a cut-and-cover construction method to build tunnels beneath the roads above, and to accommodate previously steam-operated trains. The remainder of the LU network is formed of deep-mined ‘tube’ tunnels, comprising 37% of track. Figure 1 shows where the different network types are located. Most of the surface part runs through the suburbs of outer London, while the sub-surface part is primarily located around the centre of London, mostly north of the River Thames. The deep tube tunnels run through the city centre, most of which pass beneath the Thames, with a short length located to the south. Many disruptions that cause delays to service can propagate quickly across a transport network, and this includes the effects of weather. The scale of disruption can be severe for a metro network like the LU, due to the frequent train service and high passenger capacity. For example, peak service on the Victoria line is almost one train per minute,1 so the loss of this service if even for a short amount of time would affect the movement of many passengers travelling along that line. Additionally, rail and metro networks contain critical nodes, such as large interchange stations: a single point of failure on one line that serves an interchange station can lead to further delays on other operating lines and networks (see, for example, Jaroszweski et al. (2015) and Ferranti et al. (2016)). Infrastructure systems are also interdependent. For example, failures on third-party transport networks can also impact the service on the LU network, and transport systems depend on other infrastructure such as water, power and telecommunications systems to operate (C40 Cities, 2017). Even a small loss in electricity across the national British railway network, for example, can lead to a large proportion of passenger trip disruptions, and the loss of signalling and monitoring assets are most disruptive to other railway operations (Pant et al., 2016). Greater London has a humid temperate oceanic climate, classified as Cfb in the Köppen–Geiger system (Beck et al., 2018). According to the latest UK climate projection data (Met Office, 2018c), the climatological baseline (1981–2010) temperature for the Greater London administrative boundary was 11°C, with the warmest monthly mean baseline temperature in July (18°C) and the coldest shared between January and February (5°C). The coldest monthly minimum temperature in the baseline period was −3°C (February 1986), whereas the warmest monthly maximum temperature was 28°C (July 2006). A large area of London, primarily in the city centre, experiences the urban heat island effect (Oke, 1973), where the built environment absorbs the solar irradiance during the day and re-radiates heat from buildings at night, raising the local temperatures. Historically, the nocturnal urban heat island intensity across London was approximately 1–2 degC (Wilby, 2003) and more recently 1–3 degC (Zhou et al., 2016; Levermore and Parkinson, 2019). The tunnel thermal environment differs from the rest of the LU network. Long-term operation of the LU has led to a gradual build-up in tunnel temperatures (Gilbey et al., 2011). This is primarily due to train operations, particularly through the heat produced from train braking mechanisms, as well as insufficient ventilation to remove said heat (Mortada et al., 2015). In recent years, tunnel temperatures have stabilised year-round at temperatures well above 20°C, with a small seasonal fluctuation in line with seasonal surface temperatures. Certain sections of the tunnels can exceed 30°C on the hottest days of the year (The Evening Standard, 2017; The Independent, 2019). Some studies demonstrated that the fluctuation in tunnel temperatures through the year is, to an extent, a function of surface temperature (for example, Kimura et al. (2018) and Jenkins et al. (2014)). This means an increased likelihood of more frequent instances of high tunnel temperatures, or higher peak tunnel temperatures, which have implications for both human health and the operation of the LU network. The global climate is changing. The global-mean surface temperature in 2011–2020 was 1.09 degC higher than 1850–1990 (IPCC, 2021) with a slightly higher increase observed in the UK (Kendon et al., 2022). In London, heatwaves have also increased in frequency (Slingo et al., 2021). To quantify the changing temperature patterns, observations can be compared to annual baseline values. The UK Met Office uses several surface temperature indices (ETCCDI, 2009; Met Office, 2018b, 2022), some of which are shown and defined in Table 1. These are useful to help show whether mean surface temperatures are increasing across the year (i.e. warm nights, warm days, warm spell duration index [WSDI] days) or whether summer temperature extremes are increasing (i.e. summer days, hot days, heatwave days, tropical nights). This study explores changing temperature indices using observations for Greater London, which are available via the UK Met Office Integrated Data Archive System (MIDAS), and based on St. James's Park in Westminster, central London (Met Office, 2019). St. James's Park is considered here to be the best weather station for this purpose because it is the most central weather station geographically in Greater London and therefore central within the overall LU network. The results in Table 1 are indicative of recent warming in London. For example, over half the study period days (2006–2018) meet the warm night criterion, which would be days above the 90th percentile of minimum daily temperature for the baseline period. Warm night, warm day and WSDI day indices consider temperatures throughout the year and showed that recent increases were greatest in spring and autumn months. On the other hand, summer day, hot day, heatwave day and tropical night indices are indicative of peak summer warming. The average share of summer days, hot days and tropical nights in the baseline period was 2.9%, 0.3% and <0.1%, respectively. Table 1 therefore shows that the study period's share of these days has also increased. Network Rail and TfL use the 90th percentile data of the medium–high (RCP2 6.0) and high (RCP 8.5) emissions scenarios to inform decision-making related to climate change (Network Rail, 2021; TfL, 2021). RCP 6.0 is considered a compromise between likely future emissions reductions and current observed emissions, while RCP 8.5 is a ‘worst-case scenario’ and representative of climate extremes should emissions reductions not be realised (Dale et al., 2018). Using a subset of climate projection data for the Greater London administrative boundary via the UKCP18 User Interface (Met Office, 2018c), the RCP 6.0 90th percentile describes a mean annual surface temperature warming (relative to the 1981–2010 baseline) of 2.6 degC by the 2050s and of 4.8 degC by the 2080s, whereas the RCP 8.5 90th percentile describes warming of 3.7 degC by the 2050s and of 6.7 degC by the 2080s. These surface temperature increases are consequently likely to affect tunnel temperatures. Using the fundamental methods developed by Kimura et al. (2018) with surface temperature observations from St. James's Park, future tunnel temperatures were estimated according to UKCP18 projections via the User Interface. The warmest LU lines at present (Bakerloo and Central) estimated daily maximum tunnel temperatures on both lines to exceed 30°C throughout the year in both scenarios by the 2080s, including some stations experiencing several months frequently exceeding daily maximum tunnel temperatures of 35°C in the RCP 8.5 scenario. TfL reporting on climate change preparedness shows that all its assets, operations and services carry some degree of weather- and future climate-related risk (TfL, 2021). Figure 2 shows the distribution of these risks across the organisation by type of weather and sector of the business. For the LU, the number of temperature-related risks is the second highest, behind precipitation. Several of the major temperature-related risks to the LU are linked to service delays from staff or passenger heat exposure but are still relevant to asset performance. This is because lost staffing hours due to temperature (as it would be unsafe to work in for extended periods of time) could impact operational decisions and lead to missed maintenance, which in turn could affect asset conditions. Data source: TfL, 2023 Quantifying the impact of weather events on railway infrastructure and assets can be challenging as it is highly dependent on data quality. Data entries may include subjectivity by the individual who records a fault, including its cause. It is also important to note that maintenance undertaken to address a fault can be either corrective or reactive. Corrective maintenance addresses faults identified through other maintenance activity and repaired outside of routine servicing, whereas reactive maintenance responds to service disruptions while equipment is in operation (TfL, 2022a). Reactive maintenance usually requires more urgent action than corrective, to limit the extent of delays to service that may already have begun to occur. Accessing appropriate data and ensuring its integrity is a known challenge for infrastructure operators when attributing the effects of weather on their assets (Fu and Easton, 2016). For TfL, its asset management systems and passenger delay databases include weather-related categories to assign to data entries. Categorisation is typically straightforward to allocate in the event of snow, ice or heavy rainfall that leads to surface flooding, as impacts are clearly visible. On the other hand, temperature is harder to directly link to an asset fault. The result is a potential underreporting of temperature, particularly extreme heat, in faults and ultimately passenger delays across the network (Ferranti et al., 2016). Additionally, it implies that the impact of heat upon assets and rates of failure are less well understood. Calculating fault exposure rates is an effective method to address the existing subjectivity in fault and delay data categorisation. This requires combining reliable, daily spatiotemporal weather data (in this case, St. James's Park weather station data), such as daily minimum, mean and maximum temperatures across an area with fault data, then normalising across the study area by the frequency of temperature intervals and number of assets at that location (Fisher, 2020). The resulting outputs are normalised fault exposure values per temperature interval, for example, per 1 degC in daily mean temperature. These are indicative of what temperature ranges resulted in more fault incidents overall. There was also an adjustment to temperatures across the surface part of the LU network to the nearest 100m grid using an urban heat island intensity to capture spatial temperature variance (EEA and Copernicus Climate Change Service, 2020). Each network type has a slightly different thermal environment, and these require separate analyses to understand the overall effect of temperature on fault exposure rates. Figure 3 shows the total fault exposure rates for each network type for point-related assets3 across the LU network between 2006 and 2018 inclusive. The surface part of the LU network is most exposed to the weather, and the combination of high temperatures and solar radiation can lead to several known asset failures, including track buckling. Most of the surface part of the LU network is around the suburbs of outer London, which are less densely built up than the city centre. Therefore, while surface assets may be less impacted by the urban heat island effect, the openness leads to greater exposure to solar radiation. Corrective fault exposure rates on the surface for the assets shown in Figure 3 were relatively consistent at all temperatures, though increased at the highest observed maximum daily temperatures in the study period. For surface assets, this can be linked to increased monitoring activity to prevent heat-related failures. In the tunnels, the two large increases in the fault exposure rates were associated with several different data entries. However, only two entries underpin the highest corrective tunnel fault exposure rate peak. Reactive fault exposure rates were the highest at the lowest observed maximum daily temperatures (below 0°C), but these were infrequent instances across the study period compared with high temperatures. Overall, surface fault exposure rates were otherwise low but began increasing slightly from a maximum daily temperature of 24°C. The sub-surface LU network type is the smallest by track length but includes some of the oldest infrastructure. From a weather perspective, this network type is somewhat covered and so is sheltered from the highest temperatures but still exposed enough to show similar trends to the surface part. Figure 3 shows relatively consistent corrective and reactive fault exposure rates across the sub-surface part of the LU network. The high reactive rate at the lowest maximum daily temperature (approximately 3°C) was an outlier observation, as the following temperature intervals report rates of 0, and aligned to the days around the lowest observed daily maximum surface temperatures. The tunnel part of the LU network includes some of the oldest deep-mined tunnels in the world, having begun construction in the late nineteenth century. As a result, there are a range of complex thermal issues due to the legacy design and consequent limitations on retrofitting the infrastructure for cooling. The narrow-mined tunnels primarily run through clay and acted as a heat sink over several decades, which has gradually reduced in efficacy. Heat has now stabilised in the tunnels, with a very low diurnal temperature change and a small seasonal fluctuation. Observed temperatures in the tunnels can be high, leading to increased passenger thermal discomfort (Jenkins et al., 2014) and potentially an increased risk of illness such as heatstroke. In Figure 3, corrective fault exposure rates accelerated at intervals where maximum daily temperatures exceeded approximately 28°C, while the reactive rates were comparatively lower to corrective yet did increase at intervals higher than 30°C. Despite increased corrective maintenance, there were still instances of increased reactive fault exposure rates when some of the highest daily maximum tunnel temperatures were observed. The fault exposure rates presented in this paper indicate increased asset failure rates at the highest temperatures across all network types, but particularly in tunnels. TfL already undertakes corrective maintenance when surface temperatures are high; however, there remains a small but noticeable increase in reactive fault exposure rates on the surface and tunnel parts of the network. This indicates that the LU network is likely to require further adaptation of its infrastructure to climate change to help protect customers, staff and assets. Additionally, the fault exposure rates highlight a substantial difference in response to extreme cold in comparison with extreme heat that merits further investigation in terms of adaptation through monitoring and response. Although extreme cold is representative of fewer days than extreme heat events, there were no increases in corrective fault exposure rates at lower temperatures, but an increased reactive rate. This suggests that current corrective maintenance may not detect cold-related faults prior to network operation during an extreme cold event. It may be indicative of the differing weather characteristics and operational capacity underpinning failures in cold weather. For instance, asset failures in cold temperatures may combine with ice and snow, which can also be more localised and unpredictable as weather hazards. Instances of extreme cold in a warming world are likely to reduce, though may still occur, and it must be recognised that their albeit infrequent occurrence severely disrupts operations (such as during the ‘Beast from the East’ in early 2018 (Met Office, 2018a)). Indeed, TfL does and continues to research and undertake several heat management countermeasures in preparation for extreme heat across the LU network. Countermeasures shared in public are primarily hard measures via advancements in technology and engineering. Examples include air-conditioned rolling stock across the sub-surface lines; cooling units and ventilation upgrades across the Victoria line (Botelle et al., 2010); research on groundwater cooling methods (Ampofo et al., 2011) and waste heat extraction (Davies et al., 2019). There was even a competition in 2003 launched by the former Mayor of London to design solutions to cool the tunnel network, although no practical, workable solutions were successful (BBC, 2005). Currently, there are plans to introduce air-conditioned trains for the first time in the deep tube tunnels on the Piccadilly line from 2025 (TfL, 2018, 2022b), and a trial of cooling panels at a disused deep tube tunnel at Holborn station (TIES Living Lab, 2022). The fault exposure rates indicate that, without further interventions, the operation of the LU network will likely face future heat-related challenges owing to future climate change. This would be primarily due to an increasing frequency of hot days or heatwaves, which may include their occurrences earlier and later in the year. Future observed temperatures may also include observations higher than those reported in Figure 3, so the level of impact these instances may have on faults cannot yet be quantified. Mitigating these future high temperature risks may require adaptation countermeasures such as conducting preventative maintenance at lower observed temperatures than at present, or earlier in the year in the lead-up to the summer months. To make effective climate adaptation decisions for the future, data quality is imperative. The LU asset management databases were not originally designed for environmental analysis and so there are inconsistencies when converting entries into fault exposure rates. Additionally, temperature data were joined to fault data entries according to the date the fault was raised, but corrective maintenance entries specifically were often closed many weeks or months afterwards. It is therefore unclear when exactly maintenance took place, which could affect the associated temperature observation. Without the knowledge of the LU staff who enter these data and the engineers who undertake the maintenance work, it is difficult to retrospectively correct data. Data from other stakeholders are also essential to support the decision-making process. Fault exposure rates provide a useful metric on the resilience of the LU network to weather, but it depends on the availability of other data, such as weather exposure frequencies, to calculate them. Converting fault exposure rates into future fault estimations due to climate change would require projected temperature exposure frequency data. These data are not directly available from the Met Office, though could be calculated from existing data. Combining fault exposure rates with projected temperature exposure frequencies provides revised temperature thresholds, which could impact design standards and the planning of operational and physical interventions. Therefore, working with stakeholders to design and provide the most appropriate projection data is crucial to improve the capacities of decision-makers. Infrastructure networks are only as resilient as the systems they depend on, so cross-sector collaboration is critical to address infrastructure interdependencies and cascading risks. The UK's Infrastructure Operators Adaptation Forum (IOAF) is the only known national cross-sector forum for sharing best practice on reducing infrastructure vulnerabilities to climate change (House of Commons and House of Lords, 2022). TfL is a member of the IOAF, so can utilise the forum to facilitate further external stakeholder engagement. TfL's recently published adaptation strategy also begins to address other pan-organisational processes that would also increase its adaptive capacity to climate change that directly acknowledge these factors mentioned above to improve adaptation decision-making. It represents progress in more cohesively integrating actions across the whole organisation from the short term to the long term. Proposed actions include training on carbon literacy, strengthening engagement with inter- and intra-organisational stakeholders and improving information and data management (TfL, 2023). Using existing data, the LU network shows signs of vulnerability to temperature extremes, but better data quality would help improve fault exposure rate analyses. The multi-stakeholder exchange of knowledge has proven effective in developing climate-resilient policies (Ndebele-Murisa et al., 2020). For TfL, improved data quality could be facilitated by improving the data collection systems, facilitated by increased internal stakeholder engagement between those who complete fault data entries with the environmental analysts and decision-makers within TfL. Additionally, external stakeholder involvement from weather and climate data providers would support the development of fault exposure rates and appropriate forms of climate projection data. It is nevertheless important to note that this paper only presents analysis pertaining to one group of assets, so the validation of the method presented in this paper would be beneficial for other asset types to confirm the extent of fault exposure rates to temperature. Like any infrastructure owner or critical service provider, TfL would benefit from adapting to climate change as part of an iterative process that enables the continual improvement of infrastructure resilience in cycles. An iterative approach to climate change adaptation underpins guidance for transport practitioners around the world, for example, Quinn et al. (2017) and Greenham et al. (2022), and supports integrating and aligning adaptation into ‘business as usual’ activity (Quinn et al., 2018). TfL address this in its adaptation plan (TfL, 2023), which outlines the high-level actions it is taking to embed adaptation to high priority climate risks into business practices. As a result, with each cycle of business planning, while the climate may incrementally change, so would the capacities of TfL's decision-makers to develop targeted climate change adaptation actions across the LU network. As the climate changes, TfL, like many other network operators, face increased climate risks. This paper demonstrates that there are currently greater fault exposure rates at temperature extremes, which vary greatly by network type. Future climate change is also likely to further exacerbate temperature risk with an impact on faults across the LU network and TfL has responded to these risks to date with a range of hard countermeasures. TfL's adaptation plan is welcome and relevant progress in integrating practices across the organisation more cohesively. As TfL improves its data management and engagement with stakeholders, the capacity to monitor and evaluate progress in climate change adaptation should increase. As a result, the LU network has the potential to become more climate-resilient in future.

This is mainly due to denser configuration dominated by impermeable surfaces such as buildings and roads, compared to rural areas which are less densely built and mainly dominated by open spaces. Rapid urban expansion in dense cities bares direct impact on surface and air temperature patterns within street canyons; a phenomena which is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Thus, several UK city councils such as Birmingham, Manchester, and London have started to develop strategies aiming at enhancing urban green systems (UGS) through trees, green walls and green roofs. Some of those strategies include considering the green space factor, and increasing green areas within the cities to improve street canyon microclimate and reduce UHI.

Issue: Many sustainability solutions are framed around technological fixes (e.g., ""Project Drawdown"") that prioritize efficiency or innovation over systemic social and environmental change.
Implication: These approaches often neglect local contexts, fail to address root causes of inequality, and risk perpetuating existing power imbalances.
2. Economic Appropriation
Issue: Sustainability is frequently linked to economic growth or profitability, favoring market-driven solutions.
Implication: This focus on economic efficiency may overlook marginalized communities, underfund essential public services, and prioritize corporate interests over public good.
3. Neglect of Justice and Equity
Issue: Mainstream sustainability efforts often ignore distributive, procedural, and recognition-based justice.
Implication: Without addressing these dimensions, policies may exacerbate inequalities by overlooking the needs and voices of vulnerable populations.
4. Universalization of Solutions
Issue: Globalized frameworks or ""one-size-fits-all"" policies are often transplanted into diverse local contexts without considering cultural, historical, or social differences.
Implication: These imposed solutions may fail to resonate locally, erode community agency, and lead to resistance or ineffectiveness.
5. Lack of Attention to Social Dimensions
Issue: Sustainability initiatives often emphasize environmental and economic factors while sidelining social and cultural aspects.
Implication: Ignoring community values and practices may alienate stakeholders and hinder long-term adoption of sustainable practices.
6. Failure to Address Power Dynamics
Issue: Many approaches assume that consensus and collaboration are universally achievable, without accounting for power imbalances and conflicts.
Implication: This oversight can marginalize critical voices and prevent transformative change, leading to superficial or temporary outcomes.
7. Focus on Indicators and Measurement
Issue: A fixation on quantifiable metrics and indicators can lead to technocratic governance that undervalues qualitative and experiential knowledge.
Implication: This can obscure complex realities and fail to address systemic and intersectional issues.
8. Environmental Limits Misinterpreted
Issue: The concept of ecological limits is often framed in ways that emphasize scarcity and control, rather than resilience and adaptation.
Implication: This may lead to exclusionary policies that disproportionately impact marginalized groups under the guise of environmental protection.
9. Inadequate Consideration of Future Generations
Issue: Efforts to ""meet the needs of future generations"" often overlook the immediate needs and rights of present populations, particularly the disadvantaged.
Implication: This creates a tension between present and future priorities, leading to short-sighted or unjust decisions.","The book ""Just Sustainabilities: Policy, Planning, and Practice"" explores the integration of justice and equity into the sustainability discourse, focusing on urban environments and their complex challenges. It critically examines the intersections of environmental, social, political, and economic dimensions, proposing strategies to foster just and sustainable communities globally.

","Abstract Background: Several machine learning models, seeking to assess and predict rates of child malnutrition, have been developed in recent years in response to a growing burden of under-five child malnutrition in conflict and crisis settings. These models aim to either identify the strongest predictors of malnutrition among children in a given context, provide a framework for predicting the nutritional status of a given child (classifying them as either malnourished or not) based on individual information about various health-related, socioeconomic, and geographical factors, or do a combination of both. However, these models are often limited in their potential to provide practical or actionable insights due to the often limited interpretability of complex mathematical models, the “black box” nature of some machine learning models, and the complex interactions that exist between various drivers of child malnutrition, which make it difficult to fully conceptualize this system in the form of a model. Methods: In order to reconcile the complex, highly accurate but hard-to-interpret outputs a machine learning model can provide with conceptual understandings of malnutrition and its interconnected contextual drivers, we sought to understand whether quantitative analysis of the determinants of child malnutrition aligned with conceptual understandings of the causal pathways of child malnutrition. In this study, we take Yemen as a case study for this analysis and using Bayesian analysis, explore the roles of diarrheal disease, food insecurity (quantified through food consumption score) and the interactions between them in driving child malnutrition in Yemen. Results: Our analysis revealed that, contrary to intuitive reasoning, a progressive increase in food consumption did not necessarily lead to progressive decrease in a child’s risk of malnutrition. We also found that the presence of both diarrhea and poor food consumption together significantly increased the risk of severe malnutrition, as compared to either one on its own. Results of all analyses revealed that exploring the impact of any given factor on child malnutrition risk independently using standard modeling techniques is insufficient for holistically considering the pathways to malnutrition and their complex interactions. Conclusion: By aiming to quantify the conceptual framework for child malnutrition this way, we can more holistically consider the pathways to malnutrition and their interactions and consider the dependencies and interactions that exist between various health-related interventions in order to maximize their impacts, rather than simply knowing that specific factors may be independently associated with malnutrition risk through quantitative analysis, without fully understanding why this is true or how this can be translated into program-level insights.

","Reviewed by: A History of Water Engineering and Management in Yemen: Material Remains and Textual Foundations by Ingrid Hehmeyer Jethron Ayumbah Akallah (bio) A History of Water Engineering and Management in Yemen: Material Remains and Textual Foundations By Ingrid Hehmeyer. Leiden: Brill, 2019. Pp. 319. Recently, history of technology as a discipline and the general focus in science and technology studies (STS) have witnessed shifts toward understanding technology and technical knowledge as everyday practice. Another trend is interest in global processes, which obviously needs to be grounded in local evidence. Ingrid Hehmeyer's A History of Water Engineering and Management in Yemen embodies these trends. Based on archeological evidence to supplement ancient texts, it also expands our view beyond the Global North. A History of Water Engineering and Management in Yemen seeks to understand the intergenerational transfer of knowledge about water supply and management practices spanning several epochs and presents them as ordinary people's everyday experience of providing for their livelihoods sustainably. Eight case studies constitute the core of the book, spread over five parts. Part 1 focuses on irrigated agriculture in ancient South Arabia. This is well explained through the case of the Oasis of Mārib, where the author explores the controlled irrigation network. By emphasizing that ""to appreciate what people accomplished in each of these places, we must first address the different environments in which they settled and learned to harness the available resources,"" Hehmeyer underscores the understanding that indeed the local context informs people's innovative and inventive capabilities. Part 2 explores four case studies: Sayl Irrigation in Wādī Zabīd, the importance of the agricultural hinterland to pre-Ottoman Zabīd, engineered water systems in Wādī Zabīd, and water and wastewater in the city of Zabīd. Through these cases, the author discusses indigenous versus traveling ideas (technical skills) and further demonstrates the engineering sophistication of the traditional or local practices of procuring and managing the scarce water resources for daily sustenance. Part 3 explores the issue of underground water and the technologies of procuring it in the context of a falling water table and how society adjusted to managing it as a resource. Part 4 introduces the dimension of water storage. The cisterns of Al-jabīn become the lens through which the author demonstrates the technicalities involved in the construction and maintenance of stored water for use in times of plenty and paucity. Part 5 takes the reader through the interpretation of water as a scarce natural resource and the sociocultural permutations that accompany people's everyday experiences with water. Retrospectively, this book contributes to the emerging body of literature about water provisioning in the Global South, in this case the Middle East, and complements works like Nyanchaga's (2016) History of [End Page 1191] Water Supply and Governance in Kenya (1895–2005) and Bohman's (2010) Framing the Water and Sanitation Challenge: A History of Urban Water Supply and Sanitation in Ghana, 1909–2005. Although the reliance on archaeological evidence and ancient Islamic or Arabian texts may be challenging or cumbersome for a non-Arabic reader, Hehmeyer has masterfully exploited these sources for understanding the thinking and imagination behind technology in everyday use. The notion of repair and maintenance that is recently receiving much attention from historians of technology also gains credence in this work. A History of Water Engineering and Management in Yemen offers interesting insights into ancient, medieval, and premodern water access practices and various imaginaries of forms of water. Water integrates into people's lives and fuses with people's sociocultural and religious norms. It is a stimulating and elaborative read that brings out the totality of water as a resource and its political, economic, and sociocultural facets both in their simple and complex forms. Hehmeyer's work is valuable for bolstering global studies of technology and puts people as users at the center of STS.

","Abstract Background Yemen is regarded as one of the Middle East’s poorest countries. Decades of political, economic, and social difficulties have culminated in the current protracted conflict. As a result, the globe experienced its worst humanitarian catastrophe. The ongoing war has affected several public services, notably the health sector, which is operating at less than half its capacity. This study aims to examine Yemen’s health system at the governorate level (Al Hodeida) amidst the current conflict. It analyzes current challenges and produces suggestions for enhancement. Methods The study used qualitative research methods such as Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and document analysis. The study used WHO’s health systems framework to measure health system performance. Twelve KIIs were conducted via Skype with several health stakeholders. In addition, documents were analyzed to inform the subject guide, generate themes, and aid in the triangulation of results. Results According to the study findings, the governorate health system managed to offer a minimum level of healthcare services while making some advances in outbreak control jointly with other partners. One of the main difficulties confronting the governorate’s health system is a severe lack of financial resources forcing it to rely entirely on external aid. Furthermore, other significant deficiencies include inadequate health system organogram, low reporting capacities, insufficient funding, and scarcity of health professionals. Conclusion Yemen’s frail health system has been weakened by almost eight years of insecurity and conflict. If the current scenario continues, most of Yemen’s health system’s operations and indicators will likely deteriorate. On the other hand, progress in some areas, such as primary healthcare (PHC) services and disease management, is remarkable. However, for better performance, Yemen’s health system leadership and stakeholders should seek a holistic strategy to improve the entire dimensions of the health system. "

The base data for this research were collected and organized from meteorological, satellite images, remote sensing data, essential geographic data, and various data sources and used as input data into four machine learning (ML) algorithms. In this study, RS data (Sentinel-1 images) were used to detect flooded areas in the study area. We also used the Sentinel application platform (SNAP 7.0) for Sentinel-1 image analysis and detecting flood zones in the study locations. Flood spots were discovered and verified using Google Earth images, Landsat images, and press sources to create a flood inventory map of flooded areas in the study area. Four ML algorithms were used to map flash flood susceptibility (FFS) in Tarim city (Yemen): K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), random forests (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Twelve flood conditioning factors were prepared, assessed in multicollinearity, and used with flood inventories as input parameters to run each model. A total of 600 random flood and non-flood points were chosen, where 75% and 25% were used as training and validation datasets. The confusion matrix and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were used to validate the susceptibility maps. The results obtained reveal that all models had a high capacity to predict floods (AUC > 0.90). Further, in terms of performance, the tree-based ensemble algorithms (RF, XGBoost) outperform other ML algorithms, where the RF algorithm provides robust performance (AUC = 0.982) for assessing flood-prone areas with only a few adjustments required prior to training the model. The value of the research lies in the fact that the proposed models are being tested for the first time in Yemen to assess flood susceptibility, which can also be used to assess, for example, earthquakes, landslides, and other disasters. Furthermore, this work makes significant contributions to the worldwide effort to reduce the risk of natural disasters, particularly in Yemen. This will, therefore, help to enhance environmental sustainability."

The focus is primarily on the dynamics of power, the fragmentation of the state, and the emergence of sub-state actors following the 2011 uprising and subsequent civil war. The analysis revolves around the nature of authoritarian practices in a fragmented polity rather than quantifiable research variables. Therefore, no detailed information regarding specific research variables can be extracted from the available contexts."," - Authoritarian governance in Yemen, particularly pre-2011, is characterized by co-option of elites, opposition figures, and civil society, alongside repression. 
- The fall of President Ali Abdullah Saleh post-2011 uprising led to a fracturing of elite bargains, resulting in civil war and external intervention by 2015. 
- In post-2015 Yemen, the concept of a centralized authoritarian state has become irrelevant due to the emergence of significant sub-state actors. 
- The fragmented polity indicates that authoritarian control is no longer monopolized by a single actor, complicating the understanding of governance in conflict. ","The provided contexts do not contain information regarding real-time applications.

- Overall, the findings suggest a need to rethink the implications of authoritarianism in the context of fragmented sovereignty and ongoing conflict. "," - The paper highlights the shift from centralized authoritarian governance to a fragmented political landscape in post-uprising Yemen, indicating that traditional state authority has been undermined by the rise of sub-state actors. This fragmentation complicates the understanding of governance and control in conflict situations.  
- It suggests that strategies for political engagement and conflict resolution must adapt to the realities of multiple power centers rather than relying on a singular state authority.  
- The findings may inform policymakers and scholars about the dynamics of governance in similar contexts, emphasizing the need for nuanced approaches to state-building and conflict management. ","Authoritarian governance in pre-2011 Yemen conformed to many of the stereotypes of the MENA region. The tenure in office of long-time president Ali Abdullah Saleh depended on a number of stratagems ranging from co-option of elites and opposition political figures, external patronage, the co-option of civil society and, when necessary, outright repression. Saleh lost power in the aftermath of Yemen's 2011 uprising. The fracturing of the elite bargain that followed the fall of his regime ultimately led to civil war and external intervention in 2015. In post-2015 Yemen it has become effectively meaningless to talk about the authoritarian practices of a centralised state either in response to opposition or in pursuit of regime maintenance. Rather, what has developed is a fragmented polity in which the power of the central state is severely constricted by the emergence of significant sub-state actors (with external patronage) and in which the adoption of authoritarian forms of control is no longer the monopoly of any single actor. This chapter reviews these developments and examines the question of what it means to speak of authoritarian governance in a fragmented state in the course of a conflict in which the power of central government is contested.

","Abstract The climate of Yemen remains largely unstudied, leading to major uncertainties and a lack of understanding of future extreme rainfall events and how they are likely to affect agriculture. Here, we examine future heavy rainfall events for the period 2025–2100 using the latest state-of-the-art Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP 6). Based on differences in rainfall regimes, we divided the study area into two distinct parts: Highlands and the Red Sea Coast &amp; Tihama Plain region. Analyzing annual total precipitation when daily precipitation exceeds the 95th percentile of wet day precipitation (R95p), we found that models predict 16–25% heavier future rainfall over the Highlands than across the Tihama Plain and other agricultural parts of Yemen. By mid-century, the Highlands will experience ~ 25% heavier rainfall than other agricultural areas under SSP2-4.5 and ~ 16% heavier under SSP5-8.5. In both cases, the risk of rejecting the null hypothesis ( H 0 ) when it is true is lower than 5%. These results suggest that whether the current status quo of emissions continues, or the radiative forcing level is stabilized at 4.5 W/m 2 , heavy rainfall events are projected to increase more over the Highlands than over other agricultural areas of Yemen. Considering the projected increase in heavy rainfall events, we argue that Yemen desperately needs investments and innovations that will foster readiness and overall climate disaster preparedness. Efforts and investments will need to be directed more toward bridging the gap between producers of climate information and end users. Ultimately, these efforts will contribute to shaping the future of farmer decision support across Yemen. "

","Estimating evapotranspiration (ET) is of the highest importance for understanding and eventually intervening in the water cycle of natural systems. ET is one of the major factors influencing climate change, at local, regional and global levels, and net primary productivity models, but it is difficult to measure and predict.

In this study, a surface energy balance method, which combines meteorological observations with spectral data derived from remote sensing measurements, was used to estimate the ET. The modified (SEBAL) Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land has been applied to data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) onboard the NOAA-14 satellite and from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) for the estimation of the surface albedo, surface temperature (T0), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), net radiation, soil heat flux and sensible heat flux to estimate Evapotranspiration and surface conditions, on 1st June 1998 for the Sanaâ€™a Basin in Yemen, which is an arid and semi-arid region, with a mountainous terrain condition,. The actual ET was computed from field data during the satellite overpass and integrated for 24-h on a pixel-by-pixel basis for daily ET distribution and compared to the value obtained from the AVHRR and TM data. Being a mountainous basin, an attempt has been made to consider terrain effects in estimating net radiation by adding DEM information. As a result, a daily ET map over the Basin was used to analyze some observation data, such as radiation and surface temperature, and was compared with estimated data. The results showed that AVHRR gives some reasonable values; however, the TM data gives better results since the spatial resolution of TM is better than that of AVHRR"

The study addresses both researchers of the energy-health-conflict nexus and Yemen analysts. We perform interviews, QGIS mapping, hierarchical clustering, and logistic regressions to review the situation, identify relevant patterns, and estimate the conflict's impact.

A large, spatially concentrated group of mid-sized facilities managed to go from no electricity to all-solar (‘Solar Centres’). The role of conflict is non-monotonous and depends on the exposure and type. Both the most-affected and least-affected facilities tend to have electricity, while those in between are left behind. Ground combat decreases the probability of obtaining solar energy, while airstrikes do not.

","The chapter explores a paradox – the apparent impossibility of decentralization in a country where orography, a long history of political fragmentation, and a vulnerable central state authority would appear naturally to favor decentralized authority. Through a historical exploration of governance in different parts of Yemen since 1960, it reveals longstanding demands for decentralized governance, as well as the existence of a strong society capable of formulating and pressuring the central authority to implement decentralization reforms. It then analyzes efforts from 2013 to 2015 to produce a new constitutional order built on federal principles – first through a broad-based National Dialogue and, then, through a far less inclusive constitutional drafting process. This quite revolutionary project of founding a federal Yemen with six regions was eventually buried under Gulf Cooperation Council coalition bombs from March 2015 onward. The chapter concludes by exploring the circumstances that led to the rejection of a federalist solution and the eruption of civil war in Yemen, but notes that federalism, far from being an imported concept, has generated rich intra-Yemeni intellectual debates. A six-region federal Yemen might not be the way forward, but a “federalism of the provinces” could be a path for future reconstruction of Yemen. "

More than half of physicians were satisfied with the way of pharmaceutical marketing in Yemen. Personal relationships and medical samples and gifts were the factors affecting their prescriptions, being reported by about a third of physicians each. Meanwhile, most physicians (44.0%) preferred medical conferences and exhibitions as a promotional benefit to be gotten for prescribing the company’s products. The majority of physicians (62.0%) agreed that the availability of medical samples affect their prescriptions, and about 28.2% of physicians reported that all medical samples are used by their patients. Most physicians (37.0%) perceived that only 50% of medical representatives respond well to their queries related to marketed drugs, and 41.5% of physicians agreed that global companies are more compliant with ethical marketing. About 60% of the physicians reported not facing unethical promotions, and the majority (54.0%) agreed that unethical pharmaceutical marketing is the responsibility of companies, physicians, and representatives. There was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of drug prescriptions affected by medical representative visits and availability of medical samples on prescription in relation to the work experience of physicians. On the other hand, there was a statistically significant difference in facing an unethical promotion offered by companies for prescribing their products and the attribution of unethical pharmaceutical marketing in relation to the type of medical profession of physicians. Conclusions: Pharmaceutical marketing in Yemen still depends on traditional tools, with the lack of ethical guidelines or codes for pharmaceutical marketing in the country. Work experience and medical profession of physicians can significantly affect pharmaceutical marketing. The spread of unethical marketing is the responsibility of pharmaceutical companies, physicians and medical representatives. Therefore, it is recommended to develop well-defined and updated ethical standards and national guidelines for pharmaceutical marketing by the Ministry of Public Health and Population. Furthermore, official campaigns should be regularly carried out to control and restrict unethical promotion. Further studies on the ethics of pharmaceutical marketing are also recommended. Pharmaceutical companies should continuously train their medical representatives and provide physicians with the latest medical knowledge about new drugs."

","Management of water resources under climate change is one of the most challenging tasks in many arid and semiarid regions. A major challenge in countries, such as Yemen, is the lack of sufficient and long-term climate data required to drive hydrological models for better management of water resources. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of accessible satellite and reanalysis-based precipitation products against observed data from Al Mahwit governorate (highland region, Yemen) during 1998–2007. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM 3B42), Unified Gauge-Based Analysis of Global Daily Precipitation (CPC), and European Atmospheric Reanalysis (ERA-5).

This study aims at exploring and documenting the forms of health system fragmentation in humanitarian and conflict-affected contexts by studying Yemen as a case study. We collected national qualitative data from key informants through in-depth interviews. A pool of respondents was identified from the Ministry of Public Health and Population, donors, and non-governmental organizations. Data were collected between May and June 2019. We interviewed eight key informants and reviewed national health policy documents, and references provided by key informants. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. We further conducted a literature review to augment and triangulate the findings. Six themes emerged from our datasets and analyses, representing various forms of fragmentation: political, structural, inter-sectoral, financial, governance, and health agenda-related forms. Health system fragmentation in Yemen existed before the conflict eruption and has aggravated as the conflict evolves. The humanitarian situation and the collapsing health system enabled the influx of various national and international health actors. In conclusion, the protracted conflict and fragile situation in Yemen have accentuated the fragmentation of the health system. Addressing these fragmentations' forms by all health actors and building consensus on health system agenda are recommended. Health system analysis and in-depth study of fragmentation drivers in Yemen can be beneficial to build common ground and priorities to reduce health system fragmentation. Furthermore, capacity building of a health system is fundamental for the humanitarian development nexus, health system integration, and recovery efforts in the future."

","Abstract Humanitarian aid (HA) is needed in Yemen to cope with the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. However, current practices of distributing aid in the form of food have not had the desired effect; conflict has continued, and war economies are thriving as a result. Thus, this paper proposes the idea of cash assistance as an alternative form of HA. Our empirical analysis of HA in Yemen shows that cash assistance is a more effective and efficient way of distributing aid in comparison to food aid. This is due to food aid being vulnerable to looting by the conflicting factions, enabling funds to be inadvertently captured into the highly problematic war economy dynamic. In comparison, cash assistance targets a wider scope of peoples’ necessities, in a more efficient and effective delivery approach that can be easily tracked by the donors. Cash aid can either be unrestricted, restricted, or conditional. The former allows cash transfer, the second enables vulnerable people to purchase items depending on their needs with vouchers, and the latter links the money distributed with performing a certain task. This allows communities to improve and develop, and it enables individuals to build up their skill sets and have a source of income. This is particularly important for NGOs who are unable to provide the conditions needed to bear their success. The Yemeni people have lost trust in the warring factions, as well as local and international NGOs, due to the lack of effectiveness of current methods of HA distributions due to looting and the risks associated with reaching vulnerable people. Therefore, it has become imperative to restore donor direct HA delivery by providing cash aid as a superior means of food aid in Yemen, to ensure the effectiveness of HA and to improve the lives of those who are suffering, in the long term (This article builds on previous scholarship; see Elayah, M., &amp; Fenttiman, M. (2021). Humanitarian Aid and War Economies: The Case of Yemen. The Economics of Peace and Security Journal , 16 (1). This article provides a nuanced and high-quality examination of the conduct of armed groups in Yemen. The analysis of HA in this article “supports the view that it is a significant source of funding for armed groups and consequently that it plays a huge part in allowing the war economy in Yemen to thrive”. Warring groups are often looting HA to distribute it based on partisanship and to sell it on the black market to finance the war effort. They have also attempted to block HA to try and gain control over the humanitarian campaign and receive a cut of the billions of dollars given in foreign assistance. In many cases, HA is distributed through local NGOs that were established by the groups to attract international funds. Others were pre-politicized NGOs that channeled funds to specific regions or particular groups for political and military advantage. It is clear from our analysis that the ability of NGOs to use HA effectively and deliver it to those who deserve it is very limited. NGO’s actions can end up expanding the war economy rather than reducing the effects of war on the poor.

","\n Many modern conflicts, from Iraq to Yemen, have emerged as brutal wars in which state and non-state actors directly and indirectly target a wide array of civilian infrastructures, including water, energy and food systems. Similar to many twentieth-century wars, a common feature of the wars in the Middle East and North Africa in the twenty-first century has been the ‘civilianization’ of war, as civilian casualties far outnumbered battlefield deaths. We explore the targeting of civilian infrastructures in the Yemeni war (2011–2019) to explicate the connections between conflict, hunger and disease. We draw upon interviews with UN and humanitarian organizations, an original database tracking civilian infrastructure destruction, and a variety of print sources to document the extent and spatial distribution of the targeting of water, energy, agricultural and health systems in Yemen. We elucidate how the conduct of the Yemeni war has undermined human security and livelihoods and has created ethical, logistical and organizational challenges for humanitarian organizations and for advancing peacebuilding efforts. We find that after the 2011 popular uprising, some non-state actors targeted the energy sector; however, the scope and intensity of wartime targeting of civilian objects, particularly those associated with agriculture, fisheries and health, increased significantly once the Saudi-led coalition entered the war in 2015. Loss of livelihoods, internal displacement, currency depreciation, and blockades and sieges further intensified the wartime spread of hunger and disease. The targeting of civilian infrastructures significantly hinders peacebuilding efforts to restore basic services, rebuild livelihoods and strengthen governance mechanisms."

In this study, the delivery of health services is investigated both before and during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at public hospitals in Yemen to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the utilisation of health services. Method Data collected from 127 hospitals in Yemen were reviewed using the DHIS2 system. The data represented 3 months before the outbreak of COVID-19 between January and March 2020 and during the outbreak of COVID-19 outbreak between April and June 2020. The results were then compared with the same period in 2019. The utilisation pattern of healthcare services during the period of investigation was compiled and analysed by applying a generalised estimating equation (GEE) to examine the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in Yemen. The data collected from the targeted hospitals included information related to consultations, surgeries, deliveries, C-sections and penta-3rd dose immunisation. Results The trendline of health services used during the pandemic showed a gradual decline beginning from April 2020 for consultations, surgeries and penta-3rd dose utilisation. The GEE model revealed a significant effect (p<0.05) during the outbreak compared with preoutbreak in the consultation services (B=−1,343.9; 95% CI −1,767.2 to −920.6; χ2=38.718), surgeries (B=−54.98; 95% CI −79.13 to −30.83, χ2=19.911) and penta-3rd dose (B=−24.47; 95% CI −30.56 to −18.38 and χ2=62.010). As for deliveries and C-sections, the results were shown to be statistically non-significant. Conclusion The impact of COVID-19 on continuity of health services delivery in Yemen has been distinct and profound, where the study revealed that the number of the consultations, surgeries and number of vaccinated children have been declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, likely due to the partially lockdown measures taken and fear of being infected. However, the deliveries and C-section services remained nearly in the same level and did not affect by the COVID-19 pandemic."

","Yemen is ranked 154th out of 187 countries in the Human Development Index, a ranking that has generally held steady since 1990. The violence and political upheaval of the past year in Yemen have resulted in large-scale displacement of Yemeni people and deterioration of the Yemeni civil infrastructure. Yemen continues to grapple with the decline of its water resources. In terms of per capita water availability, Yemen is the most water-stressed country in the world and one of the ten poorest in terms of all available resources. The typical paradigm for international aid tends to divide funds and efforts into three categories: relief, recovery and development. The international community tends to respond to natural or political disasters with large sums of financial and material aid, which result in no meaningful reduction in vulnerability to the next (and often imminent) crisis. This paper suggests (based upon a case study of a World Food Program food-for-work initiative in Hajja and Hodeidah, Yemen) that investments of labor, materials and funds in food or financial relief (emergency response) should be coupled with innovative and uncompromising commitment to improvements in Water, Sanitation and Health (WASH)-related policies, practices (e.g., hand-washing, community-led total sanitation), and infrastructure (e.g., watershed improvements, cisterns, water filters, wells, rainwater harvesting systems, hillside terraces, latrines, toilets, etc.) that result directly in local ownership of greater food security, health, and control of water resources (including invulnerability to and resilience in the recovery from floods and droughts)."

Attaining experience in utilising online learning would transform the convictions of students, and this cannot be traced through a cross-sectional scrutiny. Moreover, the research relies upon self-testified measures for ascertaining the recommended research model. The reason behind this is that obtaining objective information regarding performance was not likely because of the privacy concern.,Despite the fact that Yemen is a low-income emerging nation with inadequate resources (World Development Indicators, 2017), it can capitalise on online-based learning that provides the advantage of excellent education and that too with limited supplies (Dokhan and Akkoyunlu, 2016; Yang et al., 2016). Additionally, online learning can enhance administration and communication, empower learning anywhere and anytime, and endorse fairness of education.,This study supplements the existing studies on information systems by blending overall quality, compatibility, TL, actual use and client satisfaction for estimating the effect of online learning among students from nine state-funded Yemeni universities. Moreover, the recommended model’s predictive prowess has a higher capability to elucidate and estimate the performance effect as against those acquired from few of the previous studies."

Results Of the 12 363 married women of childbearing age, 38.0% (95% CI: 36.4 to 39.5) reported using any form of contraception. However, only 32.8% (95% CI: 31.4 to 34.2) of them used a modern contraceptive method. According to the multilevel analysis, maternal age, maternal educational level, partner’s educational level, number of living children, women’s fertility preferences, wealth group, governorate and type of place of residence were statistically significant predictors of modern contraception use. Women who were uneducated, had fewer than five living children, desired more children, lived in the poorest households and lived in rural areas were significantly less likely to use modern contraception. Conclusions Modern contraception use is low among married women in Yemen. Some individual-level, household-level and community-level predictors of modern contraception use were identified. Implementing targeted interventions, such as health education on sexual and reproductive health, specifically focusing on older, uneducated, rural women, as well as women from the lowest socioeconomic strata, in conjunction with expanding availability and access to modern contraceptive methods, may yield positive outcomes in terms of promoting the utilisation of modern contraception."

","The chapter bears upon the challenges for food security in Yemen and the factors that constrain sustainable development of the agriculture sector. The serious constraints that prevent the agriculture sector to flourish include, inter alia, low productivity, lack of financial resources, inadequate marketing systems, low human resource, poor infrastructure, dearth of suitable production technologies and insufficient availability of inputs. The government has also been responsible for the poor state of agriculture because over the years due to financial crisis it has not assigned high priority to this vital sector of economic activity. External factors such as climate change, internal social conflicts, and security issues are also negatively impacting on the agricultural sector. The government has to spend a huge amount of money to import food commodities to meet its food requirements, although considerable potential exists to earn a significant amount of foreign exchange by exporting its good quality coffee. A major portion of the meager resources (land and water) of the country is being utilized to produce qat – a narcotic plant chewed by the huge segment of population. The qat is gradually replacing coffee and appears to be the chief rival of the coffee crop, restricting its growth to small pockets of land. Thus, in the present scenario, the country needs a sound plan, and a pragmatic policy that could re-establish agriculture sector to ensure food security and alleviate rural poverty. Agricultural extension can play a critical role in addressing the issues faced by the agricultural sector and help in enhancing food supplies. Unfortunately, the National Agricultural Extension Service (NAES) in the country is also beset with innumerable problems that, besides others, range from organizational weakness, lack of resources, poor extension staff performing non-extension activities with no clear responsibilities. The chapter provides in-depth analyses of the issues and challenges that render NAES ineffective and inefficient. If measures are taken in letter and spirit to improve the National Extension Service, it can help the country realize sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to identify the constraints faced by the agricultural sector and national extension system and suggest suitable innovative strategies that could improve crop yields and ensure food security through sustainable agricultural production systems."

A semistructured questionnaire was used to collect data on behavioral and environmental risk factors such as drinking water from public wells, storing water in containers, consumption of unwashed vegetables or fruits, and sharing a toilet.
Results: The median age of the cases and controls was 20 years (range 5-80) and 23 years (range 5-85), respectively. Only 6% of cases and 4% of controls were employed. Multivariate analysis showed that eating unwashed vegetables or fruits (odds ratio [OR] 7.0, 95% CI 1.6-30.6, P=.01), storing water in containers (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.3-7.3, P=.01), drinking water from a public well (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.7, P=.02), and using a public toilet (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.1-24.4, P=.04) were significantly associated with cholera infection risk.
Conclusions: The cholera transmission risk factors in Al Hudaydah city were related to water and sanitation hygiene. Therefore, increasing awareness of the population on the importance of water chlorination, and washing fruits and vegetables through a health education campaign is strongly recommended."

- The decline in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indicates a pressing need for effective fisheries management strategies to ensure the sustainability of these vital resources.  ","The Socotra Archipelago (Yemen), a group of four islands off the north-eastern tip of Africa in the western Indian Ocean, has a population that relies heavily on small-scale fishing for livelihoods and food security. However, the reporting of fisheries catches by Yemen has consistently been incomplete, with artisanal (small-scale, commercial) catches underreported and small-scale non-commercial subsistence and recreational catches not reported at all. Here, we reconstruct the total small-scale catches and fishing effort from the waters of the Socotra Archipelago for 1950 to 2019, and derive catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) estimates for these fisheries. The catch officially reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization on behalf of Yemen that was assumed taken from the archipelago is thought to be around 20% of the total reconstructed catch for the archipelago. The reconstructed small-scale catch increased from ~1,500 t in 1950 to an all-time peak of 12,000 t in 2000 before declining to 3,300 t by 2014. Thereafter, catches increased again slightly to just over 3,700 t·year-1 by 2019. Artisanal catches accounted for around 70% of total small-scale catches prior to 2010, but made up only around 46% by 2019. Conversely, subsistence catches increased from ~1,000 t in 2010 to ~2,000 t in 2019, and accounted for 54% of total catches by 2019. Small-scale fishing effort increased by over 1000% since 1950 and reached over 11 million kWdays by 2019. The CPUE derived for small-scale fisheries declined by 78% since 1950, from 1.4 kg·kWday-1 to 0.3 kg·kWday-1 in 2019, with most of the decline occurring after 2000. Our findings suggest resource overexploitation, and may assist efforts to more sustainably manage the Socotra Archipelago’s fish stocks. Small-scale fisheries support food and nutrient security of the local population, not least during political and humanitarian crises such as in Yemen."

","In Yemen sits the 16 Century walled city of Shibam, now listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site. Beyond its historical and cultural significance, something about the place is striking from a design viewpoint. Shibam, like many other ancient settlements, embeds much local wisdom in its own design. Its unusually tall buildings were constructed with locally sourced mud. Its fabric is dense and creates much needed shade in the city's narrow streets. Studies demonstrate its rather sophisticated—and certainly low‐carbon—approach to passive environmental design at both urban and building level, ensuring degrees of thermal comfort in such a hot climate [1]. In the same region, also sit large cities such as Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Shibam and Riyadh, of course, have radically different sizes and economies and are not generally comparable. But it must be noted that those contemporary centres have mainly developed beyond their old historical towns, hinging not on local knowledge but on ‘international’ criteria— normally dictated by modernist visions of urbanism and architecture. Yet, in the harsh climate of the Arabian Peninsula, it takes much effort—and energy—to sustain cities made of steel‐and‐glass buildings buffered by large public spaces. Saudi Arabia seems to use about 70% of its electricity consumption simply to operate air conditioning systems. Why am I invoking an ancient town to discuss smart cities? The point is that adopting and implementing technologies— however past or contemporary—cannot be seen as deterministically positive. It all depends on a more complex, and holistic, understanding of design approaches. Similarly, implementing new technology should not suggest jettisoning what is already there, and what we have already learnt—in a city, a place—as wholly inadequate and out‐of‐date. Shibam and all similar places might have been ‘old’ and unsuitable to accommodate rapid urbanisation, but they also embedded accumulated knowledge, wisdom and awareness of their context. Innovation, yet with such lessons in mind, could be precious in shaping contemporary cities in the same region. The point therefore is that ‘making smart’ without a deep understanding of place is probably not that smart after all. Yet, the prevalent ways to frame and represent smart urbanism seem based on either rejecting the past and present city as being inadequate in tackling the big societal challenges it faces, or at best ignoring what it can offer. The prevalent discourses tend to portray cities as on the one hand, the key arena of human inhabitation and growth, yet on the other, as an increasingly broken environment. Cities—it is often argued —are under pressure by the critical challenges of overpopulation, mobility and infrastructural adequacy, environmental and social sustainability, resource scarcity, and safety. This, together with ever‐changing lifestyles, makes them incapable of coping with the future, unless they embrace deep technological change. They are a ‘patient’ whose body is failing and where the only sensible cure is intrusive (technological) prosthetics. I resist such vision, as much as I see learning from Shibam as a more instructive and long‐term useful way of designing urban environments than relying on any carbon‐ copy glass‐and‐steel quick‐fix. The ‘city’ cannot be simplistically interpreted as a generic background of buildings and people—the latter normally framed as middle‐class consumers following global, standard lifestyles—onto which new digital ‘solutions’ get superimposed and where only the latter are given agency. So, whilst ‘smart’ might bring on an innovative wave of ideas and initiatives aimed at improving urban living and sustainability, there is a clear risk of making the same mistake of modernist urbanism approaches and ending up implementing context‐blind, generic models of development that lead to urban ‘solutions’ that are oblivious to the power, inner knowledge, and wisdom of place."

Until about two generations ago, Yemen had been agriculturally self-sufficient owing to its fabled systems of agriculture. However, bad policy, bad evidence, bad governance, and constant warfare have each played their respective part in forging the country's food crisis, rural impoverishment, and ecological distress. To address these root causes of Yemen's social dislocation and dismantling of its indigenous agroecological practices and self-sufficient food economy, I bring into focus the fundamental question of Yemen's national development by way of posing the agrarian question in Yemen as a question of independence and autonomy. I argue for sensible, inward-looking, and pro-production policy action that not only promotes durable growth but also progressively restores Yemenis' sovereignty as well as security."

","Yemen is among the poorest countries in the region. It has become apparent during the current political crisis in which the majority of population is classified as poor so the poverty line's group has been widened. As far as Zakah is concerned, it is a duty on wealthy people to pay their alms to the poor and hence a redistribution of the wealth among the society would be achieved. Zakah rests under the responsibility of the government to supervise, govern, and apply the rules prescribed in the Islamic legislation (Shari'ah rules) to ensure that its role in the society is attained. For the last three decades, since the formation of the new country, the “Republic of Yemen” that emerged from two previously separated countries, Zakah institution has been governed and managed by the government, and its administration is formed under the responsibility of the Zakah Agency, and later on under the local counsel of each locality. Such management and administration has been criticized of being less transparent on Zakah resources on both collections or distributions issues. Therefore, Zakah efficient collections have suffered due to the low level of confidence in the governmental agencies assigned to collect Zakah funds, and this encourages Zakah payers to always seek an alternative way to channel Zakah funds, which has been found in many voluntary organizations to carry the same role the government should have made in collection of Zakah funds. This chapter is theoretical in nature. It aims and focuses on the discussion of administration and legislation of Zakah and its importance to the society in Yemen. It also highlights the current status of Zakah in Yemen. More than that, the discussion elaborates that Zakah in Yemen lacks its role in the society in reducing poverty, which has become more apparent recently. Analyzing the way Zakah is carried out revealed that Zakah administration needs a rethink on how to organize and restructure it in a way to serve its underlying purposes. Government may not be the proper Zakah administer at this point of time due to the rise of corruption in the government agencies. Since the Zakah fund is commingled with the other public budget resources, it is more likely to be misused as the other resources (i.e., oil and gas and tax) and no possible differentiation to be expected. Expected transformation of Zakah is needed and the role can be carried out by the non-government bodies supervised by scholars and experts who can be held accountable under certain governance system. This chapter originally is of importance to all stakeholders as it serves as the building block for initiating a proper system or framework of Zakah administration, a system that provides its contemporary guidelines on Zakah, taken into the consideration the original wisdom and objective of Shari'ah on Zakah enforcement by the Almighty."

Design/methodology/approach-) Secondary data was used to measure the variables to specify the effects of independent variables on the dependent variable. Data was collected from various internal and external resources. The collected data were analyzed by using eviews statistical package version 7 to explain the results of data. The analysis firstly tests unit roots for the DS, FDI and GDP by using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) tests. Secondly assesses the equilibrium relationship between GDP and its probable determinants of DS and FDI through applying Johansen and Juselius (1990) tests finally determine the causality direction between the variables employed Granger-causality tests. Findings The study results indicate that there is long run relationship between domestic savings and foreign direct investments with real income growth in Yemen. Foreign direct investment has statistical, significant, and inelastic effect on real income (-0.299) while domestic savings are not statistically significant in the long term coefficients. Error correction model exposes that Yemeni real income converges to its long term equilibrium level reasonably low at -0.01884% by the foreign direct investment and domestic savings contributions; however, this coefficient is statistically significant. Lastly, Granger causality tests illustrate that there is a bidirectional relationship between DS, FDI and economic growth. Savings is driven force but foreign direct investments are output. If savings and income increase, the foreign direct investments were attracted more. Also, this study has confirmed that saving is an income driven in Yemen. Limitation of Study: That there is no accurate information about the previous years before the unity. So that the researcher ignores that information and start from unity country generated. Another limitation, is that focus only on Yemeni economy and the around circumstances with no concentrate on international variables because There is no significant impact on world economy as a result of economic fluctuation in Yemen. Also this research aims to study how to develop investment climate in Yemen as well as attract new FDI to Yemen."

","Abstract Yemen has been facing political, economic and social challenges since 1990. The fragility of Yemen’s situation has led to a widespread conflict in 2015, resulting in the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Amid the humanitarian catastrophe and the collapsing health system, a platform for coordinating humanitarian health response, called the National Health Cluster, has expanded its operations across the country. The study aims to evaluate the performance of the National Health Cluster in Yemen between 2015 and 2019. A qualitative research design was employed, and ten semi-structured interviews with key Health Cluster stakeholders were conducted. The study applied the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in Humanitarian Action (ALNAP) guide to evaluating humanitarian action using the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria. Six evaluation criteria were selected: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, effects, connectedness and participation. Inputs from interviews were manually transcribed and then analysed using NVivo 12 software. The study results indicate that the Health Cluster in Yemen has contributed to saving lives and strengthening the local health capacities in diseases surveillance. In addition, its positive effect was evident in improving the humanitarian health response coordination. Nevertheless, engaging health stakeholders, especially national organisations, was suboptimal. Exit strategies were lacking, while services to address mental health, non-communicable diseases, senior citizens and people with disabilities were not prioritised in the Health Cluster strategic plans and partners’ response. To ameliorate Health Cluster performance, revising its objectives and establishing a cluster-specific rapid response funding mechanism are pivotal. Furthermore, preparing the national health system for recovery and actively engaging all stakeholders in the Health Cluster’ response and strategic decisions would maximise its positive impact on Yemen’s health system and population.

- Policymakers are encouraged to adopt integrated approaches that enhance nutrient use efficiency in crop and livestock production, addressing food insecurity and resource shortages in Yemen.  
- Overall, the findings advocate for informed dietary choices and strategic agricultural practices to promote sustainability. ","Food nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) footprints are indicators for determining the losses of N and P over food production (FP) and food consumption (FC) chain. Yemen is an interesting case because, given the country’s heavy dependence on food imports, food insecurity, and poverty, the N footprint (NF) and P footprint (PF) could affect its future development. However, NF and PF over time have not yet been studied in Yemen. Therefore, this is the first paper to compute the NF and PF in Arabian Peninsula (a case study from Yemen) by an adjusted model of N-Calculator, by computing virtual N (VNFs) and virtual P (VPFs) factors for main foodstuffs. The NF (kg N cap−1 year−1) and PF (kg P cap−1 year−1) elevated from 5.56 and 1.20 in the 1960s to 15.2 and 4.79 during 2011–2017, respectively, while the national NF (Gg [109 g] N year−1) and national PF (Gg P year−1) increased from 27.7 and 6.77 in the 1960s to 358 and 122 during 2011–2017, respectively. Cereal was the largest contributor to the NF and PF in Yemen over the past 57 years. FP contributes approximately 80% and 86% of the total NF and PF during 2011–2017. Therefore, if possible, the best way for consumers and farmers in Yemen to decrease NF and PF is to focus efforts on increasing FP and FC of foodstuffs with less VNFs and VPFs. The consumption of vegetable-fruit, legumes, starchy, eggs, poultry, and fish should be increased as their NF and PF are low. However, people in Yemen suffer from shortage of resources and lack of awareness, and thus they do not have the opportunity to choose foodstuffs that are low in NF and PF. Accordingly, policymakers should encourage integrated approaches that introduce powerful tools for controlling crop and livestock production in conjunction with enhancements in nutrient use efficiency."

","Dear Editor: Many researches and studies have shown a relationship between high and cold air temperature and an increase in mortality, especially for patients with cardiovascular disease.[5,6] Recently, associations between ambient temperature and morbidity have also been reported,[7,8] even though these associations have not always been similar in magnitude to mortality,[8] and null findings have also been reported.[9] Also, while the association between temperature and cardiovascular mortality has been reported to be U- shaped in many studies,[10] the association with cardiovascular hospitalization was reported to be linear in the US [7]. Increased blood pressure (BP) is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality [14,15] and for coronary heart disease and stroke morbidity [16,17]. Therefore changes in BP might also play a part in the development of cardiovascular events that are associated with changes in temperature. The mechanisms behind temperature-related cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are not fully established. As elevated BP is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke events, BP can also be part of the mechanism leading to temperature-related deaths. Epidemiological studies have shown that cardiovascular diseases rank first among the causes of death in China and have become a major disease within the Chinese population [18]. The effects of type 1 and type 2 diabetes on the body's physiological response to thermal stress is a relatively new topic in research. Diabetes tends to place individuals at greater risk for heat- related illness during heat waves and physical activity due to an impaired capacity to dissipate heat. Specifically, individuals with diabetes have been reported to have lower skin blood flow and sweating responses during heat exposure and this can have important consequences on cardiovascular regulation and glycemic control. Those who are particularly vulnerable include individuals with poor glycemic control and who are affected by diabetes-related complications [19]. As a result of the war and the siege on Yemen, the deterioration of living and health conditions, the interruption of electricity, the suspension of salaries for six years, and the arrival of about 80% of the population of Al-Hodeidah Governorate to a level below the poverty line. We have monitored as a result of the high temperature, which reached 48 degrees Celsius in the city of Hodeidah, 28 deaths of people with diabetes and arterial hypertension were monitored for the period from 5-6-2022 to 25-6-2022. This catastrophe occurred due to the government power outage as a result of the war and the siege on Yemen and the inability of people to buy expensive commercial electricity. This is considered a humanitarian disaster that requires a serious stand by the government, international organizations and the international community to save Hodeidah residents from extreme heat and poverty by providing electricity and humanitarian aid to contribute to improving the health and living situation in the governorate and supporting hospitals with fuel by the World Health Organization."
